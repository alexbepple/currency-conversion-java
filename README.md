This is an example for working with legacy code that I use in teaching.

The original code is the one that Brett Schuchert has used in talks about working with legacy code.

* Watch him work with the C# version: <http://vimeo.com/34484105>
    * Get the code [here](https://github.com/alexbepple/CurrencyConversion-CSharp-MSTest).
* See "[A story about too much power](http://schuchert.wikispaces.com/JMockIt.AStoryAboutTooMuchPower)" for a written treatment of the Java version of this example.


# Git branches

* `master` The legacy code we start out with.


# Working with the code

Run all tests with `./gradlew` (*nix) or `gradlew.bat` (Windows)

Create project files with `./gradlew eclipse` or `./gradlew idea`
